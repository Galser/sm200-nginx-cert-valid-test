2. **For managing infrastructure** we using Terraform - open-source infrastructure as a code software tool created by HashiCorp. It enables users to define and provision a data center infrastructure using a high-level configuration language known as Hashicorp Configuration Language, or optionally JSON. More you encouraged to [learn here](https://www.terraform.io). 
3. **This project for virtualization** uses **AWS EC2** - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2 for short) - a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers. You can read in details and create a free try-out account if you don't have one here :  [Amazon EC2 main page](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) 
4. **Nginx stands apart - as it will be downloaded and installed automatically during the provision.** Nginx is an open source HTTP Web server and reverse proxy server.In addition to offering HTTP server capabilities, Nginx can also operate as an IMAP/POP3 mail proxy server as well as function as a load balancer and HTTP cache server.
